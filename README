Ext on Rails plugin


Install
=======

1) install this plugin

Use "svn co" or "svn export" for installing method, because "plugin install"
has a bug that fails to fetch all files named 'httpXXX'.

   cd vendor/plugins
   svn co http://wota.jp/svn/rails/plugins/branches/stable/ext/


2) install following plugins too.

This plugin depends on following plugins.

   ruby script/plugin install http://wota.jp/svn/rails/plugins/branches/stable/dsl_accessor/
   ruby script/plugin install http://wota.jp/svn/rails/plugins/branches/stable/named_options/

Here, feel free to run plugin command, because these don't contain
any 'httpXXX' files.


3) install Ext js library


Execute following lines in RAILS_ROOT directory.

   wget http://www.yui-ext.com/deploy/ext-1.0-alpha3.zip
   unzip ext-1.0-alpha3.zip
   cd public
   ln -s ../ext-1.0-alpha3 ext

Now, you can see "public/ext/XXX" files.


Paginate
========

  class UserController < ApplicationController
    ext_paginate User, 10
  end

then visit '/user/index'
